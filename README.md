SpaceDoors 
==========

A space game implementation for teaching the basics of programming to my 12 year old nephew.
This was done in Processing due to its simplicity. 

Note that the code is not structured in an "elegant" or object-oriented way on purpose. It is build step by step, from scratch, trying to avoid too much abstraction or even calculation (when you are 12 you haven't even learned about cartesian coordinates).
